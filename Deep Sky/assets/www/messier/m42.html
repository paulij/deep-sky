				M42: Orion Nebula in
				<a href="../constellations/orion.html" class="m2c">Orion</a>
			</h2>
			
			<p>Magnitude 4.0. Located just south of Orion's Belt. Visible to
				the naked eye.
			<p>About 1,350 ly away. 24 ly in diameter. The closest region of
				massive star formation to the earth.
			<p>Contains the Trapezium, a very young cluster of stars.
				Infrared shows stars are hidden by gas and dust in visible light.
				The following image is a comparision between images in visable and
				infrared light.

			<p>Approximately 700 stars in various stages of formation have
				been observed in M42. Hubble has observed over 150 protoplanetary
				disks (proplyds), stars in the very early stages of evolution.
			<p>As young massive stars form thay generate large amounts of
				ultra violet radiation that push away gas and dust.
			<p>Within maybe 100,000 years, most of the gas and dsut will be
				blown away, and what will remain will be a young star cluster.
