				M15: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/pegasus.html" class="m2c">Pegasus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.6. 33,500 ly away and 175 ly in diameter.
			<p>The cluster may have suffered a "core collapse". At the center
				of the cluster, inter stellar distances can be as small as the size
				of the solar system, i.e. the distance from the sun to Pluto. There
				is also the possibility of a intermediate mass black hole at the
				center of the cluster.
			<p>Follow from Biham to Enif and approximately half the distance
				again to come to M15.
