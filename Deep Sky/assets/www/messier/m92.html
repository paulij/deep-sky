				M92: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/hercules.html" class="m2c">Hercules</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 6.3. About 27,000 ly away. Another fine globular
				cluster in Hercules (as well as M13).
			<p>The celestial north pole moves with a period of about 26,000
				years. At one stage in the cycle, the north pole is within one
				degree of M92, making it effectively the marker for due north. This
				wont happen for another 14,000 years though so don't wait up.
