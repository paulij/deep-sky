				<a href="../constellations/lepus.html" class="m2c">Lepus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.7. 40,000 ly away. 60,000 ly from the galactic
				center.
			<p>This globular cluster might originally have belonged to the
				Canis Major Dwarf galaxy which is currently undergoing an encounter
				with the Milky Way. (This is like M54 which is believed to
				originally belong to the dwarf Sagittarius galaxy.)
			<p>Found about 4 &deg; south of beta Leporus (Nihal).
