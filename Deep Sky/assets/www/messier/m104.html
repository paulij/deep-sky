				M104: Sombrero Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Edge on spiral galaxy in Virgo, 28m ly away. Magnitude 9.0.
				The galaxy has a large bulge and a prominent dust lane.
			<p>The nucleus of the galaxy is designated a a LINER region (low
				ionization nuclear emission region). This means it contains weakly
				ionized gas, gas that has lost relatively few electrons. LINER
				regions can be powered either by star forming regions or an active
				galactic nucleus(AGN). In the case of ths galaxy it is most probably
				caused by an AGN around a known supermassive black hole. The
				supermassive black is one of the largest known at about a billion
				solar masses.
			<p>In addition the Sombrero Galaxy has a large number of Globular
				Clusters, between 1200 and 2000. The ratio of the number of globular
				clusters to size of the galaxy is high compared to the Milky Way but
				average for galaxies with a large bulge. The number of globular
				clusters around a galaxy is now thought to be related to the size of
				the galaxies bulge.
			<p>It is unclear whether the galaxy is part of a formal galaxy
				group. it has been suggested that it is one of a galaxy pair with
				UGCA 287.
