				M67: Open Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/cancer.html" class="m2c">Cancer</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 6.1. Over 500 stars. 3000 ly away with a diameter of
				21 ly.
			<p>Between 3.5 and 5 billion years, M67 is old one of the oldest
				known open clusters. It is certainly much older than any other open
				cluster in the Messier Catalogue. It is very rare for open clusters
				to survive this long. One of the reasons for its survival is its
				distance from both the galactic center and galactic plane. This
				means there are less gravitational interactions which would tend to
				pull the cluster apart. At an age of 5 billion years, cluster stars
				would be roughly the same age as our sun.
			<p>M67 contains many red giants as there has been plenty of time
				for stars to enter their red giant phase. It also contains about 30
				blue stragglers whose origins are not well understood. (Blue stars
				that formed when the cluster formed would long ago have gone
				supernova.)
			<p>The cluster is a couple of degrees west of the star alpha
				Cancri (Acubens).
