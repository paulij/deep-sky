				M80: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/scorpius.html" class="m2c">Scorpius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.3. Class II. One of the densest globular clusters.
				32,000 ly away. Diameter 95 ly.
			<p>Contains a relatively large number of blue stragglers. These
				can be caused by collisions and subsequent merger of two smaller
				stars. Alternatively, they can be caused by slow coalescing where
				rotating binary stars gradually spiral inwards and eventually merge.
				Or by mass falling from one star to another.
			<p>Found about 5&deg; north west of Antares.
