			<h2>
				M62: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/ophiuchus.html" class="m2c">Ophiuchus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 6.5. About 22,000 ly away and about 100 ly across.
			<p>A very irregular shaped globular cluster, probably caused by
				the fact that it is very close to the galactic center.
			<p>Contains a large number of variable stars, over 200. Also
				contains six millisecond pulsars at least three of which form binary
				systems with white dwarfs.
			<p>The core is very dense and has probably undergone a "core
				collapse" like M15 and a number of other globular clusters.
			<p>Found at the very southern tip of Ophiuchus about 4&deg; below
				M19 which in turn is about 5&deg; east of Antares.
