				<a href="../constellations/aquarius.html" data-side="m2c">Aquarius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 6.4. Type II globular cluster, i.e. very
				concentrated. Globular clusters are classified from class I to class
				XII (or 1 to 12). Class I are very concentrated while class XII are
				very loose with little concentration of star towards the center of
				the cluster.
			<p>M2 is about 40,000 ly away which is beyond the galactic
				center. At about 190 ly in diameter it is one of the largest known
				globular clusters. Contains about 1,500,000 stars and has a total
				mass about 900,000 times that of the sun.
			<p>M2 forms a large right-angled triange with alpha and beta
				Aquarii.
