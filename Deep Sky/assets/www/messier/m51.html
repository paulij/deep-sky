				M51: Whirlpool Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/canesVenatici.html" class="m2c">Canes
					Venatici</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 8.4. One of the show-piece galaxies for amateurs,
				located in Canes Venatici. In fact there are a pair of galaxies.
				Distance 37 million ly.
			<p>Main Galaxy (NGC 5194):
			<p>Diameter of the disk of the disk is 86,000 ly. 160 billion
				solar masses. So slightly smaller than the Milky Way. Lots of star
				forming regions in the spirals caused by interaction with the
				companion galaxy.
			<p>Companion Galaxy(NGC 5195):
			<p>Simulations have suggested that 5194 came through the main
				galaxy from behind about 500 million years ago and then passed back
				trough the main galaxy about 50-100 million years ago. Presently it
				is to the side and behind the main galaxy.
			<p>Part of the M51 group that also contains M63 and in total at
				least 8 galaxies, 5 of which are spirals.
