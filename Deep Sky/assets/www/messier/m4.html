				M4: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/scorpius.html" class="m2c">Scorpius</a>
			</h2>

			Magnitude 7. About 7000 ly away (one of the closest). Also quite
			close to the galactic plane. Diameter 70 ly. Class IX globular
			cluster so low concentration of stars.

			<p>Has over 100,000 stars and a mass of about 67,000 times the
				mass of the sun.
			<p>Passes close to the galactic center on its orbit (5kpc) so has
				probably been stripped of a lot of its stars
			<p>1.5 degrees west of Antares so easy to find.
