				M33: Triangulum Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/triangulum.html" class="m2c">Triangulum</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 5.7. The third largest spiral galaxy in the Local
				Group.
			<p>About 3 million ly away. Diameter about 50,000 ly, half that
				of the Milky Way. Contains about 40 billion stars (400 billion in
				the Milky Way and 1 trillion in Andromeda.)
			<p>An spiral galaxy, at an angle of 54 &deg; to us. This means it
				has quite a low surface brightness and given its magnitude of 5.7,
				can be tricky enough to spot. Often it is easier to spot in good
				binoculars than say a 150mm scope.
