				M90: Spiral Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 10.3. About 60 million ly away.
			<p>The galaxy has suffered "ram-pressure stripping". This is
				where the interaction between the galaxy and the intracluster
				medium, as the galaxy moves through that medium, removes the
				interstellar medium from the galaxy.
			<p>The galaxy, along with another in Coma Berenices has been
				classified as the prototype of an "Anemic Galaxy". An Anemic Galaxy
				has low contrast between its spiral arms and its disk. They have
				very few HII regions and hence few star forming regions.
			<p>Anemic Galaxies are thought to be on the way to becoming
				lenticular galaxies. [Further on that road are "Passive Spiral
				Galaxies" found in high red-shift galaxy clusters.]
			<p>There is still star formation going on in the center of M90.
