				M45: Pleiades in
				<a href="../constellations/taurus.html" class="m2c">Taurus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Open cluster in Taurus. Also known as the Seven Sisters.
				Magnitude 1.6. Easily visible to the naked eye. The brightest stars
				take a shape similar to the plough asterism.
			<p>Distance of between 390 and 460 ly. About 115 million years
				old.
			<p>Dominated by hot blue stars. The brightest seven stars (seven
				sisters) are all B type stars with magnitudes ranging from 2.9 to
				5.0.
			<p>Nebulosity shows up in long exposure photographs. This is due
				to the reflection of light by dust. As any dust from the original
				nebula would be long gone, it is thought that the reflection nebula
				exists because the cluster is passing through a dusty region.
