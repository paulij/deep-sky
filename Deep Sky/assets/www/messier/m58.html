				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Barred spiral galaxy 68 million ly away. Magnitude 9.7.
				107,000 ly across. One of three galaxies in a row, with M59 and M60,
				about 4 &deg; west of Vindemiatrix.
			<p>Class SBc. B means it is barred. c means the arms are loosely
				wound. [a tightly wound, b intermediate]
			<p>The image is an infrared image taken by the Spitzer Telescope.
				Blue is emission at 3.6 microns, green 4.5 microns, red 5.8 and 8.0
				microns. Blue corresponds to light from mature stars while the red
				identifies where stars are forming from dust and gas.
			<p>Supernovas were discovered in 1988 (type II) and 1989 (type
				I).
