				M54: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/sagittarius.html" class="m2c">Sagittarius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.6. Highly concentrated (class III).
			<p>Estimates put M54 at 87,000 ly away. It is now believed that
				in fact it belongs to the dwarf Sigittarius galaxy, a newly
				discovered dwarf galaxy in the local group. This would make it the
				only extra galactic globular cluster in the Messier catalogue,
				though there is some speculation about M79 as well.
			<p>A distance of 87,000 ly means that M54 is very bright. It is
				estimated to be the second brightest (absolute magnitude) globular
				cluster after Omega Centauri.
			<p>There is some evidence for an intermediate mass black hole in
				the cluster.
			<p>M54 is found a couple of degrees west and slightly south of
				zeta Sagittarii.
