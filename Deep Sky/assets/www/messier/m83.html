				M83: Southern Pinwheel Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/hydra.html" class="m2c">Hydra</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Face on spiral galaxy about 15 million ly away. Six supernovae
				have been sighted in M83.
			<p>Part of the Centaurus A/M83 Group. This has two sub-groups,
				with Centaurus-A at the center of one and M83 at the center of the
				other. Both are members of the Virgo super-cluster.
			<p>The two sub-groups are close to one another and not moving
				relative to one another.
			<p>M83 is undergoing more rapid star formation that the Milky
				Way.
