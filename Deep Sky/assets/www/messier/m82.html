				M82: Cigar Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/ursaMajor.html" class="m2c">Ursa
					Major</a>
			</h2>

			<p>About 12 million ly away. The prototype "Starburst Galaxy" a
				galaxy with exception rates of star formation. The red in the image
				is glowing hydrogen being blasted from the center of the galaxy.
			<p>197 young super star clusters have been found in the starburst
				core by Hubble. This core has 10 times the star formation rate of
				the entire Milky Way. Each super star cluster contains over 100,000
				stars, has about a million solar masses and is 10 to 20 ly in
				diameter.
			<p>This behaviour is caused by the interaction with the ten times
				larger M81. It is believed most of the starburst behaviour was
				triggered by an encounter 600 million years ago. More was triggered
				by a recent encounter about 10 million years ago.
			<p>The image is a six image composite using filters and capturing
				visible and infrared light as well light from the glowing hydrogen
				filaments.
