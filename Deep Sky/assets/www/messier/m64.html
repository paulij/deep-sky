				M64: Black Eye Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/comaBerenices.html" class="m2c">Coma
					Berenices</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 8.5. Class Sb. Named because of the dark structure
				on one side of the galaxy.
			<p>Recently it has been discovered that the gas and dust in the
				outer parts of M64 rotate in the opposite direction to both gas and
				dust in the inner regions. All the stars in the galaxy rotate in the
				same direction as the gas in the inner region. The inner region has
				a radius of approximately 3,000 ly while the rest extends for a
				further 40,000 ly (radius).
			<p>This bizarre behaviour is believed to have been caused by a
				collision with another galaxy that has either been absorbed by M64
				or dissipated.
			<p>M64 is a degree to the north east of 35 Comae. It is about
				6&deg; south of the north galactic pole (perpendicular north of the
				Milky Way disk.)
