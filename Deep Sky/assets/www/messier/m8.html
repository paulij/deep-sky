				M8: Lagoon Nebula in
				<a href="../constellations/sagittarius.html" class="m2c">Sagittarius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Giant interstellar Cloud. Magniture 6.0. It is an Emission
				Nebula/ HII region.
			<p>An active star forming region. Ionization is due to a number
				of very luminous stars. In particular 9 Sagitarii is an O4 star with
				absolute magnitude -10.7, one the most powerful star of all.
				Recently it has been discover to be a binary. A number of other
				magnitude 6 and 7, really luminous O type stars also ionize the
				nebula.
			<p>Distance is about 4300 ly. Size 115ly x 50ly. This would dwarf
				the Orion nebula.
			<p>Southwest of 9 Sagitarii is the brightest part of the nebula,
				known itself as the Hourglass nebula. The Hourglass nebula is very
				young, maybe only 10,000 years old.
			<p>The nebula contains a number of Bok globules (dark, collapsing
				clouds of protostellar material). These contain new stars in the
				final stages of formation.
