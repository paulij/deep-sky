				M35: Open Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/gemini.html" class="m2c">Gemini</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 5.3 lying just off the "left foot" of Gemini. This
				is a really fine open cluster for a small telescope.
			<p>M35 is approximately 2,800 ly away. There are about 20 stars
				down to magnitude 10, 120 down to magnitude 13 and 2,700 stars down
				to magnitude 21 which could be part of the cluster. The cluster
				contains a prominant arc of stars to the north of the cluster with a
				bright double star at the north end of the arc.
			<p>NGC 2158 is a nearby cluster which is much more compact, older
				and farther away - 12,000 ly away and about 2 billion years old. It
				has survived for this long because it is so compact. In fact it was
				once thought to be a globular cluster. NGC 2158 is sen to the bottom
				right of M35 as a faint smudge in a small telescope but is quite
				prominant in the above image.
			<p>The earliest spectral type of stars in the M35 cluster are B6
				and B7. This corresponds to an age for the cluster of around 100-150
				million years old.
