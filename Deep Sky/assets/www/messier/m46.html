				M46: Open Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/puppis.html" class="m2c">Puppis</a>
			</h2>

			<p>One degree east of M47. About 5,500 ly away and about 300
				million years old. Contains maybe 500 stars. Around 30 ly in
				diameter.
			<p>In the image there is a planetary nebula which is probably not
				a member of the cluster.
