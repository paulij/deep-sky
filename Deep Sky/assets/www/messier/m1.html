				M1: Crab Nebula in
				<a href="../constellations/taurus.html" class="m2c">Taurus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>The Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant recorded by astronomers
				in 1054 AD (SN 1054). It is the only supernova remnant in the
				Messier Catalogue. Magnitude 8.4. Absolute magnitude about -3,
				corresponding to about 1000 times the brightness of the sun.
			<p>It is about 10 ly in diameter and is about 6,300 light years
				away. The nebula is expanding outwards at about 1,500 km/sec.
			<p>The emission from the nebula is cause by the expanding
				material from the original supernova colliding with the interstellar
				medium and forming shock waves.
			<p>The progenitor star is a 16th magnitude neutron star. It is 10
				km in diameter and is a millisecond pulsar, emitting pulses every 33
				ms. It originated from a core collapse supernova. Models suggest
				that the original star was between and 11 times the mass of the sun.

			
			<p>M1 is about 1 degree north of the 3rd. magnitude star zeta
				Tauri so not hard to find. Not particularly impressive in an amateur
				telescope though.
