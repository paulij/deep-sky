				M73: Four Stars in
				<a href="../constellations/aquarius.html" data-side="m2c">Aquarius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Another oddity in the Messier catalogue. Messier saw a cluster
				of star with some nebulosity.
			<p>There is some disagreement about whether this is a open
				cluster or not. All four stars are evolved giants and are quite
				close.
			<p>Found just to the east of M72, about 3&deg; south and 3&deg;
				east of the star epsilon Aquarii (Albali).
