				M12: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/ophiuchus.html" class="m2c">Ophiuchus</a>
			</h2>

			Magnitude 7.7. One of a pair of close globular clusters in Ophiuchus,
			the other being M10.

			<p>Slightly further away and larger than M12. Distance 16,000ly.
				Diameter 74 ly. About 87,000 solar masses.
			<p>A globular cluster of the inner galactic halo. It never
				travels further than 20,000ly from galactic center.
			<p>A study shows that the cluster has an unusually small number
				of low mass stars. This is probably due to them being stripped from
				the cluster by interaction with the galactic center.
			<p>Found a couple of degrees north west of M10.
