			<h2>M105: Elliptical Galaxy in 
			<a href="../constellations/leo.html" class="m2c">Leo</a></h2>
			
			
			<p>Magnitude 10.2. About 38m ly away.
			<p>Contains a supermassive black hole of between 140 and 200
				million solar masses. Also contains a few young stars and star
				clusters, showing that elliptical galaxies can create new stars, but
				very slowly.
			<p>Part of the M96 group of galaxies which also contains M95 and
				NGC 3384. A relatively close up view of M105 shows NGC 3384 and NGC
				3389. NGC 3384 is physically close by while NGC 3389 is a background
				galaxy.
