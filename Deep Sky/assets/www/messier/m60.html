				M60: Elliptical Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>One of the giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster.
				Again at 60 million ly. Class E2. Magnitude 8.8. 120,000 ly across.

			
			<p>The east most of three galaxies in a row, M58, M59 and M60,
				about 4 &deg; west of Vindemiatrix.
			<p>There is a nearby galaxy NGC 4647 (just visible in the image)
				which does not seem to be interacting with M60 so probably lies at a
				different distance.
			<p>M60 is known to contain a super massive black hole of maybe 4
				billion solar masses. The accretion disk around the black hole is
				relatively quiet.
