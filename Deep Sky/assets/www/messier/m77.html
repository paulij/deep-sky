				M77: Spiral Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/cetus.html" class="m2c">Cetus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 8.9. It is an active galaxy with an Active Galactic
				Nucleus (AGN) and is an example of a Seyfert galaxy. A Seyfort
				galaxy is one of a number of different AGNs including radio
				galaxies, quasars and BL Lacertae galaxies. All are possibly quite
				similar, the differences being due to their orientation to us and
				different rates of matter falling towards a central object.
			<p>A central object of about 100 million solar masses attracts
				matter and emits a large aout of radiation right across the
				spectrum. Gas clouds are being blown from the central regions of the
				galaxy at several hundred km/s.
			<p>Infrared observations show a central region about 12 ly This
				is surrounded by an elongated structure 100 ly across consisting of
				stars and interstellar matter.
			<p>Radio observations have found a central disk 5 ly across
				containing water molecules.
			<p>Ultra violet observations has shown intense star forming
				regions surrounding the central object. This are the brightest star
				forming regions with 100 million ly from us.
			<p>At about 60 million ly away it is a similar distance to the
				Virgo galaxies, but in another direction obviously.
			<p>The galaxy is very large with a diameter of 170,000 ly.
			<p>The image is a composite. X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray
				Observatory are shown in red, optical data from the Hubble Space
				Telescope in green and radio data from the Very Large Array in blue.
			
			<p>M77 is found just east of delta Ceti and not far from the
				famous variable star Mira.
