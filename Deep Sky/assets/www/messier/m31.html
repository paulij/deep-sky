				<a href="../constellations/andromeda.html" class="m2c">Andromeda</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 3.4. About 2.6 million ly away. The largest of three
				large spiral galaxies in our local group, the others being the Milky
				Way and the Triangulum Galaxy.
			<p>Contains about 1 trillion stars, about twice as mnay as out
				Milky Way Galaxy. However recent studies suggest that it might not
				be more massive than the Milky Way due to it containing less dark
				matter.
			<p>In the image the dwark galaxy M32 is seen just above M31 and
				the dwarf galaxy M110 is seen below and further away.
