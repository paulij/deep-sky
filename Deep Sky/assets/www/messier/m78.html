				M78: Reflection Nebula in
				<a href="../constellations/orion.html" class="m2c">Orion</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Belongs to the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex and is about
				1,600 ly away. It is north and to the east of Orion Belt. It is the
				only reflection nebula in the Messier Catalogue.
			<p>Consists of dust that reflects light from nearby stars. The
				radiation from the stars have not enough enery to ionize the dust
				and make it glow. Instead the radiation is reflected. The nebula is
				blue as the young central stars are blue and also because the dust
				particles have better reflectivity in blue.
			<p>The brightest illuminating star is HD 38563A, and
				second-brightest is HDE 38563B. Both are about magnitude 10.
			<p>About 45 T-Tauri stars are close by. These are pre main
				sequence variable stars, that is young stars in the process of
				forming. This takes about 100 million years. There temperature is
				not high enough for Hydrogen fusion. Light is given off due to the
				release of gravitational energy (heating) as the stars contract.
			<p>There are also 17 Herbig-Haro objects in M 78. These consist
				of material ejected by nearby young stars, and colliding at
				supersonic speeds with the interstellar medium. The resulting shock
				waves generate visible light.
