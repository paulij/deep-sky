				M106: Spiral galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/canesVenatici.html" class="m2c">Canes
					Venatici</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 9.1. Distance 24m ly away. The galaxy has
				substantial star formation going on in its spiral arms.
			<p>The galaxy is classified as a Seyfert II galaxy. This means
				the center is a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) seen across
				the spectrum from radio to X-ray. AGNs are caused by matter falling
				in to a supermassive black hole.
			<p>The galaxy is also classified as a Maser Galaxy. A Maser
				(Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)
				corresponds to a Laser but in the microwave radiation band.
			<p>The image is a composite image. Optical data from the
				Digitized Sky Survey is shown as yellow, radio data from the Very
				Large Array is shown as purple, X-ray data from Chandra is shown as
				blue, and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope is shown as
				red. Radio and X-ray (purple and blue) show two "arms" not visible
				in optical light. These extra arms are due to gas being violently
				heated by shock waves generated by jets coming from the AGN at the
				center of the galaxy.
