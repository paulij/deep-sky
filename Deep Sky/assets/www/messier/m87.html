				M87: Elliptical Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 9.6. About 53.5 million ly from the Milky Way.
				Supergiant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Virgo cluster.
			<p>Diameter of about 120,000 ly compared to 100,000 ly for the
				Milky Way. But given that M87 is elliptical and not jut a disk, this
				make the galaxy huge. Has about 12,000 globular clusters which again
				is a huge number compared to our 150-200.
			<p>Has an Active Galactic Nucleus containing a supermassive black
				hole. This is a strong source of radiation, especially radio waves.
			
			<p>M87 has a jet of plasma that extends for 5,000 ly, possibly
				more.
