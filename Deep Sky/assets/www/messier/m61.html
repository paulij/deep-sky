				M61: Spiral Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>About 100,000 ly across so similar in size to the Milky Way.
				Magntude 9.6. About 8&deg; south of the main cluster of galaxies.
			<p>The galaxy contains lots of star forming regions. Also its
				spiral structure is not very regular. Both of these could be caused
				by interaction with some nearby smaller galaxies.
