				M99: Spiral Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/comaBerenices.html" class="m2c">Coma
					Berenices</a>
			</h2>

			<p>About 50 million ly away. Magnitude 10.4.
			<p>In 2000 astronomers discovered a gas cloud close to M99 called
				VIRGOHI21. It seems to exerting a large pull on M99 causing one of
				its spiral arms to be more less tightly wound that the other. Some
				astronomers have concluded that VIRGOHI21 is a dark galaxy. A dark
				galaxy is a (hypothetical) galaxy consisting of dark matter.
			<p>M99 was one of the first galaxies in which a spiral was
				detected (by Lord Rosse in 1864).
