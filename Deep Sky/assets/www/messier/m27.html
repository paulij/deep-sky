				M27: Dumbbell Nebula in
				<a href="../constellations/vulpecula.html" class="m2c">Vulpecula</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.4. The first planetary nebula to be discovered.
				Also visually the best. The Helix nebula has a slightly higher
				magnitude (7.3) but is larger so the surface brightness is actually
				lower.
			<p>[A planetary nebula consists of an expanding shell of gas
				blown off by a star in the lateer stages of its life, the so called
				red giant phase. It only lasts for a relatively brief period of
				time, tens of thousands of years which is very brief compared to the
				lifetime of the star.]
			<p>Central star is magnitude 13.5 and hot with a temperature of
				85,000 K.
			<p>Estimating the age of the nebula depends on an estimate of the
				rate of expansion of the shell. Two different estimates give ages of
				2,000/3,000 and 48,000 years.
			<p>It is also difficult to estimate the distances of planetary
				nebula. Estimates range from about 500 to 3,500 ly. Maybe 1,200 ly
				is a reasonable estimate.
