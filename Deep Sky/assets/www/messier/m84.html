				M84: Lenticular Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/virgo.html" class="m2c">Virgo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Located towards the center of the Virgo cluster of galaxies.
			<p>It is a lenticular galaxy, that is mid way between a spiral
				and elliptical galaxy. They are disk galaxies that have lost or used
				up most of the interstellar matter that is used for star formation.
				They can however retain dust. They have a much higher bulge to disk
				ratio than spirals, and have lost the spiral structure in their
				disk. Face on lenticular galaxies and elliptical galaxies are hard
				to tell apart.
			<p>For a long time M84 was classified as an E1 elliptical galaxy.
