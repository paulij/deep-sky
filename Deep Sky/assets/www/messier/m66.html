				M66: Barred Spiral Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/leo.html" class="m2c">Leo</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 8.9. Class SBb. 32 million ly away.
			<p>M66 is much more active than M65 and contains lots of blue
				star clusters and star formation regions. Also the arms are
				deformed. Both are most likely caused by interactions with another
				galaxy, probably NGC3628, the third galaxy in the Leo Triplet.
