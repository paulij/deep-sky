				M29: Open Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/cygnus.html" class="m2c">Cygnus</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 7.1. Found in a fairly crowded part of the Milky
				Way. A couple of degrees south and just to the east of Sadr.
			<p>Distance is hard to estimate due to unknown light absorption
				due to dust. Estimates range from 4,000 to 7,000 ly. Age 10 million
				years so quite young. Its hottest stars are B0 giants.
			<p>The shape outlined by the main stars are extraordinarily like
				those in M45?
