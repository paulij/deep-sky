			<h2>
				M81: Bode's Galaxy in
				<a href="../constellations/ursaMajor.html" class="m2c">Ursa
					Major</a>
			</h2>

			<p>About 12 million ly away. Has an Active Galactic Nucleus and a
				super massive black hole of 70 million solar masses. There are lots
				of star formation regions in the spiral arms. This is probably
				caused by interaction with M82.
			<p>Closeness to M82 make it a nice object for amateur telescopes.
				Visible in binoculars.

			<p>Part of the M81 group, a group of 34 galaxies some 11.7
				million ly away. The group also contains as an outlying galaxy,
				NGC2403, a fine 8th magnitude spiral galaxy in neighbouring
				Camelopardis.
