					Venatici</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 9.0. About 16 million ly. The brightest galaxy in
				the M94 group which contains about 20 galaxies.
			<p>The galaxy is seen to contain two rings. Both are locations of
				active star formation.
			<p>A recent study has shown the galaxy to contain practically no
				dark matter. This is a controversial result and has not yet been
				widely accepted.
			<p>The image is an infrared and ultraviolet composite image.
