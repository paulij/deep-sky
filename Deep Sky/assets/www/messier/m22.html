				M22: Globular Cluster in
				<a href="../constellations/sagittarius.html" class="m2c">Sagittarius</a>
			</h2>

			<p>Magnitude 5.5, one of the brightest. But because of its low
				latitude it is less impressive in an amateur telescope than say M13.
			
			<p>About 10,000 ly away, one of the closest.
			<p>It and M15 are the only 2 globular glusters in the Messier
				catalogue which contain a planetary nebula. (4 Globular Clusters in
				total around the Milky Way.)
			<p>The Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico has
				discovered 2 black holes in M22, with masses between 10 and 20 solar
				masses.
